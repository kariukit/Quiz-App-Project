# Quizz-App
A quizz app using Javascript

In this project we were required to come up with a quiz app that will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write

The app had to meet the following user story:

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


The app also had to meet the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

Finally, the quiz app had to look like the following mock-up:

I came up with the quiz app and you can use the following link to see the app:
